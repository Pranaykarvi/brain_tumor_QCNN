#  Brain Tumor Detection using Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN)

This project demonstrates the use of **Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN)** to classify MRI brain scans into tumor and non-tumor categories. It blends classical deep learning with quantum computing to enhance diagnostic accuracy while minimizing the number of parameters.





## Results

- QCNN model demonstrated competitive performance with reduced parameter count.
- Visualized confusion matrix and training metrics.
